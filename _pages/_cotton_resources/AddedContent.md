Here is a list of all blocks and items we currently support. This is an ever-growing list, so make sure to check back frequently.

## Base Materials

Supported affixes for these are ingot, nugget, block, ore, dust, plate, and gear.

| ResourceType | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| copper       | great low-tier conductor for both heat and electricity. Its high ductility is the reason we think of wires as flexible. Corrodes easily. |
| silver       | corrosion resistant, and is a better conductor - both heat and electricity - than copper and gold. Rare, and loaded with magical lore.   |
| lead         | synonymous with heavy and slow. Used for irrigation pipes in the ancient world, also used to sink fishing bait, to plumb quality architecture, and for drywall or concrete anchors.|
| zinc         | a secondary product of many ores, and is a key ingredient in brass. Zinc is insanely easy to corrode, to the point where they attach zinc blocks to oil rigs to keep them from rusting. |
| aluminum     | |
| cobalt       | |
| tin          | |
| titanium     | |
| tungsten     | |

## Exotic Metals

These are rarely-used metals typically intended for high tiers and limited availability. Supports all the same metal affixes

| ResourceType | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| platinum     | |
| palladium    | |
| osmium       | |
| iridium      | |


## Radioactive Materials

These are typically power-intensive to refine and require large amounts of automation, but can pay back the effort with a huge profit. Only uranium is harvestable as an ore. The others are occasional byproducts from reactors.

| ResourceType | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| uranium      | |
| plutonium    | can't be found in a rock in any decent quantity anywhere. It's a byproduct of uranium fission, but plutonium fission is more energetic, making it a second-tier nuclear fuel capable of decaying back into uranium |
| thorium      | advanced nuclear material that can start several fission chains either burning it out, or "breeding" upwards into fissionable uranium or plutonium. |


## Gems

Gems support the affixes "", dust, block, ore, gear, and plate.

| ResourceType | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| ruby         | A red corundum (aluminum oxide) thought to offer protection from poison |
| topaz        | A yellow aluminum silicate thought to channel the element of fire |
| amethyst     | A purple variant of quartz |
| peridot      | A smart crystal ge- I mean, a captivating olivine made of magnesium and iron impurities in a silicon oxide lattice. |
| sapphire     | A blue corundum (aluminum oxide) thought to enhance confidence and communication |


## Miscellaneous

| ResourceType | Description / Affixes |
|--------------|-------------|
| coal         | coal_dust |
| coal_coke    | (and coal_coke_block) |
| mercury      | Mercury, once thought to purge poisons from the system and improve digestion, is poisonous and hurts digestion. |
| wood         | gear |
| stone        | gear |
| iron         | dust, gear, plate |
| gold         | dust, gear, plate |
| diamond      | dust, gear, plate |

## Steels and Alloys

The brass we provide is called "admiralty brass" and the proportions are exactly correct except for 1% tin which we ommitted. No method is provided to produce steel; typically this will require elaborate machines or furnaces.

| ResourceType | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| steel    | has excellent tensile strength, good for mid- to high-tier tools, structures, and machines |
| electrum | a soft metal, not appropriate for heavy machinery, but is a corrosion-resistant conductor. It was also used to top obelisks and pyramids in ancient Egypt. |
| brass    | excellent corrosion resistance and low friction, making it great for clockwork and pneumatics, instruments, and naval applications |
